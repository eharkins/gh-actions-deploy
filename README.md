# gh-actions-deploy
This is a template for deploying a Docker container (on-push) to [Github's package registry](https://github.com/features/packages) using Github Actions.

[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a continuous integration (CI) service built into Github that allows you many other capabilities, similar to other CI services like Travis, Wercker, etc.

[Here are slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/111hM9Mtt5EZqHypoK2v-goH1GDXRj6T-rcoZmGGJNnk/edit?usp=sharing) I created to show how to configure a repository like this one to deploy your container.
