# gh-actions-deploy
This is a template for deploying a Docker container (on-push) to Github's package registry using github actions.

Github actions is a continous integration (CI) service built into Github that allows you similar capapbilites to other CI services like Travis, Wercker, etc.

[Here are slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/111hM9Mtt5EZqHypoK2v-goH1GDXRj6T-rcoZmGGJNnk/edit?usp=sharing) I created to show you how to set up a repo like this one to deploy your container.
